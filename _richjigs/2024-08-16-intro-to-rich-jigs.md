### The Beginning of a Journey: Sharing My Passion for Bait Making
For the past nine months, I've been on an exciting journey, diving deep into the world of bait making. What started as a simple hobby has evolved into a passion that drives me to constantly explore, experiment, and innovate. Along this journey, I've encountered challenges, made discoveries, and learned valuable lessons that have not only honed my skills but also fueled a desire to contribute something meaningful to the bait-making community.


### Starting with a Minnow Color Combination Generator

One of the ideas that excites me the most is the creation of tech tools to inspire new jig combinations. While I’m still in the early stages of this process, I’ve started by developing a minnow color combination generator. It’s a simple tool, but it represents the beginning of what I hope will be a series of resources that can spark creativity and open up new possibilities for myself and others in the bait-making community.

This generator is just the start. My aim is to continue building and refining tools like this one that can help bait makers experiment with different ideas and find new ways to express their creativity.

I will be writing on my DevBlog section of the website more of the technical implementation of the project.

### Blending Tech and Passion
As someone with a background in tech, I’ve always been intrigued by the intersection of technology and hands-on creativity. Bait making has become my canvas, and I’m excited about the possibilities that arise when I combine my technical skills with my love for the craft. I’m still figuring out how to bring these two worlds together in a way that’s useful and inspiring, and I plan to share that process here.

This blog is a way for me to document that journey—my experiments, my successes, and yes, my failures too. I’m not an expert, just someone who’s passionate about finding new ways to innovate within this space. If you’re interested in seeing how tech can enhance creativity in bait making, or if you’re simply curious about the process, stick around. I’ll be sharing what I learn along the way, and who knows, maybe it’ll spark some ideas for you too.
